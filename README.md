# Karatsuba-Algorithm-Visualization

A web-based visualization tool for the **Karatsuba multiplication algorithm**, developed to provide a step-by-step interactive breakdown of how large integers are multiplied efficiently. Built as a part of  Design and Analysis of Algorithms project.

## About the Project

This tool takes two or more integers (randomly generated or uploaded from a file) and demonstrates how the Karatsuba algorithm recursively multiplies them using a divide-and-conquer approach. Users can visually trace the recursive tree, observe intermediate steps, and explore how large number multiplication can be optimized.

## Features

- Complete implementation of the Karatsuba algorithm
- Input via random number generation or file upload
- Recursive tree visualization
- Zoom controls (In, Out, Reset)

**Note:** When the Karatsuba algorithm runs, the recursive tree visualization may extend beyond the visible area. If no result appears, try scrolling horizontally to see the output because it might be rendered off-screen.
